This bot will immerse you in all corners of our galaxy.

The bot has several commands:

- `/start - Show information about a bot.`
- `/about - What this bot can do?`
- `/galaxy - Show information about our galaxy.`
- `/sun_system - All about our solar system.`
- `/planets - What number of planets we have?`

## How to working with Cooperbot:
1. First, "make" some help!
```bash
make help
```
2. Second, you can try build application for your systems. Example:
### `For Linux:`
```bash
make linux
```
### `For MacOS:`
```bash
make macOS
```
### `For Windows:`
```bash
make windows
```
3. You can "make" a Docker image.
```bash
make image
```
4. Also, you can push your image for free swimming.
```bash
make push
```
5. And, the last one, my favorite, like 007 you can clean all what you dane. FBI watching you!
```bash
